# PLEASE NOTE: Requests are currently closed.

Homebrew needs to be updates by it's developers before I can continue to gen for you. This wont take long. Check back in a couple of days.



If you're here from @greybw on Instagram and you are here because you want me to create legit-hacked Pokemon for your Sun/Moon game, you're in the right place!


******************


There are a few steps you need to follow first for you to get your Pokemon:

1.) Follow @greybw on Instagram

2.) DO NOT DM or private message me requests on Instagram unless you have >3k followers. I will ignore you. This isn't personal, I just cant have my phone flooded with a thousand requests.

3.) 6 Pokemon max per request, 1 request max per week. (7 days) Sorry. I have a job and school to do too. If you really need them more often, learn to do it yourself. (https://3DS.guide)
    
    -MAKE SURE YOU READ THE RULES BELOW FOR WHAT YOU CAN REQUEST! THERE ARE SOME POKEMON/THINGS I CAN'T/WON'T GEN! These rules are subject to change.
    
4.) Email [grey.pkhex@gmail.com] the *SMOGON MOVESET* (Google it if you don't know what that is) as well as your instagram username, IGN in Sun/Moon and 3DS friend code.
    
    -If your Email is not in Smogon format, or is missing information required, it will be ignored.
    
5.) I will DM you my friend code when your Pokemon is ready. When I message you you have 12 hours to respond or you will be skipped, and your Pokemon will be wonder-traded. No exceptions. Repeat offenders will blacklisted (blocked) from future requests.
    
    -Depending on how busy I am with life and how many requests I am servicing, it could take a few days for me to get back to you. Be patient.
    
6.) The Pokemon will be TRADED to you directly. When I trade it, have something ready to give me in return. (LVL 1 Magikarp/Whatever is fine)

******************

POKEMON RULES:

-I am currently only servicing requests for Legendary/Mythical Pokemon if they in the Alolan Dex. I'm sorry. It's an issue with some PKHeX logic.

-Pokemon must be breedable. (legendaries excluded) This means NO DITTO, Silvally, TYPE: NULL, ETC. Go to (https://reddit.com/r/breedingdittos) for those Dittos. :)

-OT/Nickname Must be acceptable: No symbols or profanity. This isn't my rule, but rather Nintendo's rule. (The game will reset the Poke automatically if it detects them)
